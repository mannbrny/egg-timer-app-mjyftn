Use `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage the timer.\n4.  **Implement the Alarm:** Use the `expo-av` library to play an alarm sound when the timer finishes.\n5.  **Add Navigation:** Add a link to the `eggTimer` route in the home screen (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`).\n\nAfter this plan is implemented, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-31T08:53:04.257190"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create an egg timer app!
